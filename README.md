# CS211-Project-2
Fall 2023, CS211.
Second project for the class.
Using a dynamically allocated struct array for the organisms, this program
creates a programmed food web. We can see the category an organism would be in (like a producer),
and can see their preys. There is also an extinction function which shows the change of the food web
as an animal disappears from the web.
